- > 一般马桶水箱没水或者水满溢出来，多半是进水阀损坏
- > 正常马桶一直流水或冲水无力，多半是排水阀出现问题，这时候可以更换新的排水阀配件

### Tank fill valve
- Side-float design (ball-valve)
- Concentric-float design

  > By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.
  > 
  > Newer fill valves have a delayed action that will not start filling the tank/cistern until the flapper/drop valve has closed which saves some water.

> 浮筒的下方有个单向阀（下图绿色框内圆形），单向阀的作用是进水阀进水的时候（马桶水箱水位上升时）能阻挡水进到浮筒内部，确保水位还没满的时候浮筒不上浮（进水水位稳定），即水箱水位没过浮筒后才止水。而冲水的时候，进水阀浮筒内部的水又能通过单向阀流到水箱里面，浮筒下落后开始进水，也能起到延迟进水的作用，做到省水。
>
> 看你图示，说明进水阀浮筒内部应该还是有水的，浮筒内的水没有完全流出，受浮力作用还上浮着，大概率是单项阀出现故障了。

### Flapper-flush valve (drop valve)
> A problem with the valve type flush mechanism is that it invariably starts to leak after a couple of years use due to wear and tear of the valve, particles, etc. trapped in the valve. Quite often this leakage is barely noticeable but adds up to a considerable water wastage. In the UK it has been found that between 5 and 8% of toilets (mostly dual flush drop valves) are leaking, each one between 215 and 400 L (57 and 106 US gallons) on average per day. Whilst they save more water than they leak, regular maintenance or use of a non-leaking flush mechanism will maximise water savings.
