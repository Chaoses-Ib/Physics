[datetime - What's the difference between ISO 8601 and RFC 3339 Date Formats? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522251/whats-the-difference-between-iso-8601-and-rfc-3339-date-formats)
> RFC 3339 is listed as a profile of ISO 8601. The RFC also has some small, subtle differences. For example truncated representations of years with only two digits are not allowed -- RFC 3339 requires 4-digit years, and the RFC only allows a period character to be used as the decimal point for fractional seconds. The RFC also allows the "T" to be replaced by a space (or other character), while the standard only allows it to be omitted (and only when there is agreement between all parties using the representation).

## Fractional seconds
No maximum limit. Normally 0~9 digits.

Implementations:
- Rust
  - time: 0~9
