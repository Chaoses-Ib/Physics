# Refrigerators
> A refrigerator, commonly shortened to fridge, is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature of the room.

> A freezer is a specialized refrigerator, or portion of a refrigerator, that maintains its contents’ temperature below the freezing point of water.

> The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that the refrigerator be kept at or below 4 °C (40 °F) and that the freezer be regulated at −18 °C (0 °F).

## Brands
[Which is the best Chinese fridge maker? Hisense? Haier? Midea? Xiaomi? : r/China](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1cfsw2u/which_is_the_best_chinese_fridge_maker_hisense/)
> Haier is an old brand that has been making fridges for 40+ years, and it was once a JV with a German company Liebherr. Hisense is famous for making air conditioners, but it is also an old brand that’s been making fridges for decades. Midea is relatively newer and is mostly making small appliances. Xiaomi is even newer, and is probably is better at making anything that is internet related. So it really depends on your preferences. Do you want a more intelligent and connected fridge, or a never gonna break but probably not so smart storage space.

> As a general rule, I avoid midea products. Often cheap, and the quality shows it's cheap. Viomi fridge on the other hand has lasted well for the past 4-5 years. Never used the others, so can't say much about them.

## Chest freezers
> The physical design of refrigerators also plays a large part in its energy efficiency. The most efficient is the chest-style freezer, as its top-opening design minimizes convection when opening the doors, reducing the amount of warm moist air entering the freezer. On the other hand, in-door ice dispensers cause more heat leakage, contributing to an increase in energy consumption.

> 冰柜是上开门，开门时冷气沉底，热气不会进去。没有热气进去就没有霜。所以冰柜结霜很少，用电量也很少。
